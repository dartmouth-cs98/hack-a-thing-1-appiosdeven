# Amazon ML Image Detection 

Deven Orie

Short description of what you attempted to build

I built an iOS app that allows a user to point their phone at any object and click the Find Item Button!

This then runs an ML Model and determines what the object is and searches Amazon for this object. The data shown to the user would be shown from cheapest to most expensive. 

I worked by myself on this project. I learned how Apple ML models work, how they are implemented, a bit more on git storage, and how to use apple developer tools better as well as improved my skills with Swift. 

I had trouble pushing to git since my file was mush more than the GitHub storage limit, and I struggle with this issue for multuple hours which prevented me from commiting early on. Ultimately I decided to remove the 3 ML models from the project, since a user can earily download them back if they wanted to test out the iOS app.
